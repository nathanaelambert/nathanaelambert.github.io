## Earbrowsing
### The idea
This [interactive prototype](https://nathanaelambert.github.io/nthlmb/earbrowsing/AudioSpace.html) is an attempt at developing a new type of screen reader interaction based on audio with spatial cues. It consists of a mini game where you have to find buttons, on a screen and double clic on them. The catch: you are blind and you can only use sound to find where the button are. Move your mouse around the screen to hear the buttons that are close to your mouse.
### How it works
- use a headset, you need **stereo**
- click the [link](https://nathanaelambert.github.io/nthlmb/earbrowsing/AudioSpace.html)
- press start
- close your eyes
- use **clic** + **drag** to move in the virtual space
- **double clic** to select the element
